<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Liliane Fantou, I am French but I have been living in London for almost eight years now. I have discovered the world of coding when I was younger, during my high-school time but decided to study marketing at University. 
  I have graduated with a master in Communication and Medias but deep down, I wasn't happy. That's why I left for London, so I could focus and work on improving my English. I have been an aupair for a year before I decided to prepare the French teacher exam. But how naive of me to think I was going to go back easily to France after living in London ? London had so much to offer, it was impossible for me to leave.
  So I decided to stay in London and I found my first serious adult job as a Early Years Educator. I have been doing this for seven years now and I feel like I have seen everything that I needed to see in the education field.

<p>I needed a new challenge in my life. And with my husband being a back-end developer, I have always wanted to really understand what he was doing as a living... but it was not with my little knowledge of HTML that I was going to understand his job.
  That's how and why I have decided to sign up to a web development bootcamp but also to explore this fascinating and revolutionary knowledge that I have once quickly overviewed.. thinking it was only stopping to HTML and CSS but not, there is so much more and 
  this challenge is exciting!

<p>This is the occassion for me to learn something new and why not, have a change of career?</p>
